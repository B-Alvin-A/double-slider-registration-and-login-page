# Double-slider-registration-and-login-page

This is a double slider registration and login page. It contains styles for various elements such as the page background, headings, buttons, forms, and containers.

The page has two panels - a login panel and a registration panel - that slide in and out of view depending on whether the user wants to log in or register. The registration panel is hidden behind the login panel and slides into view when the user clicks the "Register" button.
